# I'm JosÃ© Ignacio Tapia (Joe)       
## Frontend & Fullstack  Web Developer 

**Hello everyone! I'm a frontend oriented Fullstack web developer passionate about technology. From an early age I have been interested in the digital world and have always been in search of knowledge in this field. My curiosity and desire to learn led me to discover programming, and since then, I have fallen in love with this world.

I consider myself a self-taught person and I have built my own learning path, based on the recommendations of mentors, senior developers' experiences and communities. This has helped me to develop my learning skills by using different tools such as documentation, courses, tutorials, articles, etc. It has also allowed me to learn how to find solutions to problems or bugs that I encounter in my daily work.

I love to find digital solutions to current problems and contribute to human development through technology. I am always in constant training and updating my knowledge, both theoretically and practically, doing personal, academic and cooperative projects in groups. I am passionate about programming and enjoy collaborating with others to carry out innovative and challenging projects.

If you are looking for a frontend oriented Fullstack web developer, who is constantly updating his skills and knowledge, do not hesitate to contact me. I would love the opportunity to collaborate with you on your next project.
